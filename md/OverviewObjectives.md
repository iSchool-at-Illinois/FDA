# Course Overview

## Learning Objectives

1. Introduce the mathematical bases of multivariate data analysis in information contexts.

2. Prepare students for further coursework in statistics and data mining for information-related problems.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand data analysis and data mining methods from algebraic,
   geometric, and computational perspectives in information context.

2. Solve information-related problems involving vectors and matrices.

3. Explain how data analysis routines available for higher level tools (such as the R language) work "under the hood" for solving information problems.

## Support of broader goals and objectives

This course advances the following broader learning objectives and goals:

- Degree program: Understand fundamental mathematical and programming
  tools for solving problems of information modeling, expression, and
  transformation.
